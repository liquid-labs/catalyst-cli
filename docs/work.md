### Description

Cleans up the work branches and records associated the implied unit of work. By default, the local copy of remote main branches will be updated in order to provide up-to-date information on the status in order to determine whether the work artifacts can be cleaned (removed). This can be supressed with the `noFetch` option.

[^ top](#work)

Pauses the undefined unit of work.

### Parameters

_none_

### Description

Pauses the undefined unit of work, switching each involved project back to the main branch and re-installing the package. This is an all or nothing process and it will fail with no changes unless all the projects are currently on the work branch and clean or on the main branch (in any state).

## <span id="_work_qa">`/work/qa`</span>

- `description`: _(opt, string)_\
  Optional long form description of the changes, expanding on the `summary`.
- `files`: _(opt, multi-value, string, option aware)_\
  Rather than saving everything, save only the indicated files. Files are specified in the form '[org/project:]rel/path/to/file'. When the project designation is omitted, the current project is assumed.

## <span id="_work_start">`/work/start`</span>
[^ top](#work)

Creates a new unit of work.

### Parameters

- `issueBug`: _(opt, boolean)_\
  Labels the created issue as a 'bug' rather than the default 'enhancement'. Only valid when 'createIssues' is set.

- `projects`: _(opt, multi-value, string, option aware)_\
  The project(s) to include in the new unit of work. If none are specified, then will guess the current implied project based on the client working directory.
- `submit`: _(opt, boolean)_\
  If true, immediately saves and submits the current work. Only compatible when the work is associated with a single project. This is useful for small changes already made. If the QA does not pass for any reason, it will halt the process after saving but before submission.

### Description

Creates a new unit of work involving the designated projects. By default, the local development copy of any project which is a dependency of another is linked the dependent project unless `noLink` is specified.

## <span id="_work_status">`/work/status`</span>
[^ top](#work)

Reports on the status of a unit of work.

### Parameters

- `allPulls`: _(opt, boolean)_\
  Will include all related pull requests in the report, rather than just merged or open PRs.
- `noFetch`: _(opt, boolean)_\
  Supresses default behavior of fetching remote changes before comparing local and remote branches.
- `updateLocal`: _(opt, boolean)_\
  Will update local main and working branches with changes from the respective remote branch counterparts prior to analysis.

### Description

Checks the status of a unit of work branches, issues, and pull requests. By default, the local copy of remote main branches will be updated in order to provide up-to-date information on the status. This can be supressed with the `noFetch` option.

  The resulting report contains two main sections, 'issues' and 'projects'. The issues section indicates the number, state (open or closed), and URL for each issue.

  The projects section breaks down pull requests, branch status, and merge status for each project. By default, only open or merged pull requests are included, although a count of all related PRs is included as well. To get details for all pull requests, use the `allPulls` option.

  The pull-request will be assigned to the indicated assignee(s) rather than to the submitter
- `closes`: _(opt, multi-value, string)_\
  When specified, the effective close target is noted to close the issues. The specified issues must already be associated with the unit of work. Refer to the method description and `closeTarget` for information on the effective close target. Issues are specified in the form of &gt;org&lt;/&lt;project&gt;/&lt;issue number&gt;.
  
    The primary project in the unit of work or, where specified, the first project listed explicitly will be noted to close the specified issues.
- `closeTarget`: _(opt, string)_\
  The project which closes the issues associated with the submission. See method description and the`closes` parameter for more on the associated issues.

- `noBrowse`: _(opt, boolean)_\
  Supresses default behavior of opening a browser to the newly created pull request.
- `noClosed`: _(opt, boolean)_\
  When set, then no issues are closed in a situation where they would otherwise be closed.
- `noPush`: _(opt, boolean)_\
  Supresses the default behavior of pushing local changes to the working remote. If the local and remote branch are not in sync and `noPush` is true, then an error will be thrown.
- `noQA`: _(opt, boolean)_\

### Description

Submits the changes associated with the current unit of work by creating a pull request for the changes in each project associated with the unit of work. By default, any un-pushed local changes are push to the proper remote. Each PR will reference the associated issues and linked to the primary project's PR for closing when it is merged.

Pushing chanes to the remote can be suppressed with `noPush`.

If you have portions that are complete, you can use the `project` parameter. Only the specified projects will be included in the submission. In that case, the first project specified will be considered the close target unless `closeTarget` is specified, though by default no issues are closed in a partial submit unless `closes` is specified.

By default, the system assigns the pull request to the submitter. This may be overriden with the `assignees` parameter. Where the system is configured to support it, reviewers are assigned programatically by referencing the reviewer 'qualifications'; alternatively, revewiers may be specified by `reviewers` parameter.

When no `projects`, no `closes` and `noClose` are __not__ specified, then the default is to designate the primary project as the `closeTarget` and note all issues as being closed when the close target pull request is merged. If the scope of the submission is limited by project or issue, then `noClose` is the default. In that situation, you can list specific issues closed via the `closes` parameter.

The close target is:
1. the project specified by `closeTarget`,
2. the first project listed explicitly by `projects`, or
3. the first project in the unit of work list of projects which is still active.

- `noHeaders`: _(opt, boolean)_\
  Excludes headers row from flat table outputs if 'false'.
- `output`: _(opt, string)_\
  Specifies the local file path where the output it to be saved. Otherwise, prints to stdout. If used as a flag, then the report will select its own name.
